# CS-4783-Assignment-3
# These are python files design to test and run Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNS on data sets of images.

# In order to run these code files you need the right data sets to run them.
# For the programs in Question 1, you need the file called mnist_train.csv which can be found on here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
# For the porgram in Question 2, you just need to acquire the cifar10 dataset. This can be done by importing the data set from keras by putting this line of code in the program: from keras.datasets import cifar10
